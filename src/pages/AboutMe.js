      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Kevin Rahimi — a passionate and versatile developer with a first-class BSc in Computer Science from the University of Liverpool. I thrive on solving problems through clean, efficient code and have experience across a range of technologies, from Java and Spring Boot to Python, Laravel, and React Native.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's building eCommerce platforms with Magento, creating AI-powered mobile apps, or automating workflows with Python, I enjoy turning complex challenges into intuitive, real-world solutions. My background also includes experience in consulting and technical documentation, giving me strong communication skills and a collaborative mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m always learning, always building, and always looking for meaningful projects where I can make an impact — especially in tech-driven spaces like digital transformation, fitness, or automation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s build something great together.
      </p>
